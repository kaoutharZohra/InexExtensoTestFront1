## Front End Test part 1
This is a simple react application that contains a "select/unselect all" checkbox and a list of checkboxes, the selection of all the checkboxes of the list will select the "select all" checkbox.
### Instructions:
- clone https://github.com/kaoutharZohra/InexExtensoTestFront1.git
- cd  InexExtensoTestFront1
- npm install
- npm start 

### About the code 
- To develop this application, I used react checkbox.
- NB: I tried to use "rsuite" a library of react to use checkbox group but the automatique selection of "select all"  checkbox after a selection of all the checkboxes did not work.
